/*Q1 
Design an OOP model for planning trip fuel across multiple vehicle types. 
Requirements: 
- Provide a general vehicle type with encapsulated core data (private fields) 
and validated constructors 
(invalid â†’ print an error; keep previous values). 
- Create at least two specialized vehicle types that inherit from the general type
 and introduce one private field each affecting fuel usage, with validation. 
- Define a fuel computation method in the general type; specialized types must 
override it with their own rule. 
- In a mixed collection of vehicles, given a list of trip distances, compute total 
fuel per vehicle and print 
which vehicles cannot complete the route under their own constraints 
(you define the constraint per type). */
